# The Rust Programming Language

Memory safety without garbage collection. The language reshaping systems programming.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety** - Prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time
- **No Runtime Overhead** - Zero-cost abstractions
- **Blazingly Fast** - Performance comparable to C/C++
- **Fearless Concurrency** - Safe concurrent programming
- **Growing Adoption** - Linux kernel, Firefox, Dropbox, AWS using Rust
- **Future-Proof** - Endorsed by major tech companies

## Where Rust Is Growing

- Linux kernel development
- WebAssembly applications
- Blockchain and crypto
- Game engines
- Systems infrastructure
- Cloud native tools

## Career Trajectory

Rust expertise is premium. Few developers, high demand. Senior Rust roles: $150K-200K+. Fastest-growing language community.
