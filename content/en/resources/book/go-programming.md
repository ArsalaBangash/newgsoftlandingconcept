# The Go Programming Language

Go is designed for simplicity and efficiency. Built at Google, now reshaping infrastructure development.

## Why Go?

- **Simple** - Minimal syntax, easy to learn and maintain
- **Fast Compilation** - Compiles to single binary
- **Concurrency** - Built-in goroutines for handling thousands of concurrent operations
- **Performance** - Comparable to C/C++ for systems work
- **Cloud Native** - Docker, Kubernetes written in Go
- **Growing Demand** - Go jobs increasing 50%+ year-over-year

## Real-World Applications

- Docker container runtime
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- InfluxDB time-series database
- Microservices at scale

## Job Market

Go developers are paid premium rates. Junior: $80-120K, Senior: $150K+. High demand in cloud/infrastructure.
