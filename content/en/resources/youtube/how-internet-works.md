## Why This Matters

To be free online, you need to understand:
- **How data travels** - what path it takes, who can see it
- **DNS**: How names become addresses (and why some governments censor it)
- **Routing**: Why data goes through certain countries/systems
- **Packets**: The actual pieces your information travels as
- **Surveillance points**: Where your data is most vulnerable
- **How to protect yourself**: Understanding the infrastructure to defend against it

This isn't just technical—it's about understanding where freedom is threatened and how to defend it.

## What You'll Learn

- **The basics**: Servers, clients, and how they talk
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Names to IPs (and DNS censorship)
- **IP addresses**: How computers find each other
- **TCP/IP**: The actual protocol that moves information
- **Routing**: How data finds its path
- **Firewalls & filtering**: How censorship works technically
- **VPNs & proxies**: How to bypass restrictions
- **Encryption in transit**: Protecting data as it travels
- **Internet governance**: Who controls the internet

## Why This Is Freedom Content

Understanding internet infrastructure is essential for:
- **Activism**: Knowing how to communicate safely
- **Journalism**: Understanding surveillance risks
- **Business**: Protecting sensitive communications
- **Privacy**: Knowing where your data flows
- **Resistance**: Understanding censorship mechanisms to overcome them

## Key Insight

The internet is fundamentally decentralized. No single entity controls all of it. Understanding this architecture helps you understand both its vulnerabilities and its strengths. Data flows through many countries and systems—knowing this helps you protect yourself.

## Recommended Path

1. Watch this series first (foundation)
2. Learn cryptography (protect data in transit)
3. Understand privacy tools (put it to practice)
4. Study internet protocols deeper (advanced understanding)
