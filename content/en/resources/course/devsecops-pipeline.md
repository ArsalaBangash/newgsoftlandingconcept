## Why DevSecOps Matters

Traditional approach: develop code → deploy to production → security scans (too late!)

DevSecOps approach: security at every stage → catch issues early → deploy with confidence

Security isn't a separate team's problem. It's everyone's responsibility. DevSecOps makes security a first-class citizen in your pipelines.

## What You'll Learn

### Mindset Shift
- **Shift Left**: Find vulnerabilities early in development, not production
- **Automation**: Security checks that don't slow down deployment
- **Shared Responsibility**: Developers, ops, and security working together
- **Continuous Compliance**: Monitoring compliance continuously, not just at audit time

### Secrets Management
- **Never hardcode secrets**: API keys, passwords, certificates, tokens
- **Vault-like solutions**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- **Rotation strategies**: Automatically rotate secrets without redeploying
- **Audit logging**: Know who accessed what secrets, when
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Minimize who can see secrets

### Container Security
- **Image scanning**: Check Docker images for known vulnerabilities
- **Base image hardening**: Using minimal, secure base images
- **Runtime protection**: Preventing container escape and privilege escalation
- **Supply chain security**: Ensuring images haven't been tampered with
- **Image signing**: Cryptographically verify image authenticity

### CI/CD Security
- **Secure access**: Limiting who can deploy, when, and where
- **Build environment security**: Protecting the build from malicious code
- **Artifact management**: Securing build artifacts and dependencies
- **Integration testing for security**: Adding security checks to tests
- **Compliance gates**: Automated policy enforcement before deployment

### Kubernetes & Orchestration Security
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Limiting what containers can do
- **Network policies**: Restricting communication between services
- **Pod security policies**: Enforcing container security standards
- **Resource limits**: Preventing denial-of-service attacks
- **Monitoring & logging**: Detecting suspicious activity

### Infrastructure Security
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Repeatable, auditable infrastructure
- **Configuration management**: Consistent, secure configurations
- **Compliance automation**: Automatically checking compliance
- **Patch management**: Keeping systems up-to-date
- **Firewall & network segmentation**: Layered defense

### Incident Response in CI/CD
- **Automated detection**: Spotting anomalies and attacks
- **Runbooks**: Automated response procedures
- **Forensics**: Understanding what happened
- **Rollback procedures**: Quick recovery from compromised deployments
- **Communication**: Alerting teams, users, regulators

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Security monitoring**: Detecting suspicious patterns
- **Audit logging**: What happened and when
- **SIEM integration**: Centralizing security events
- **Alerting**: Waking up when something's wrong
- **Dashboards**: Real-time security visibility

## The DevSecOps Pipeline

```
Code → Lint → Build → Image Scan → Test → Deploy Staging 
  ↓                                           ↓
  (SAST)                           Security Tests
  
  Staging → Security Scan → Deploy Production → Monitor
                               ↓
                           Continuous Compliance
                           Real-time Monitoring
                           Incident Response
```

## Key Technologies

**Secrets Management**
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- Git-Crypt, sealed-secrets

**Container Security**
- Docker Bench Security
- Trivy (vulnerability scanning)
- Snyk (dependency scanning)
- Falco (runtime protection)

**CI/CD Platforms with Security**
- GitHub Actions + security integrations
- GitLab CI/CD with SAST/DAST
- Jenkins with security plugins
- CloudBuild, Azure DevOps

**Kubernetes Security**
- Pod Security Standards
- NetworkPolicy
- OPA/Gatekeeper (policy enforcement)
- Istio (service mesh security)

**Monitoring & SIEM**
- Prometheus + security exporters
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Splunk
- Datadog, New Relic (SaaS)

## Real-World Workflows

### Scenario 1: Container Image Scanning
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. CI builds Docker image
3. Trivy scans image for vulnerabilities
4. If critical vulnerabilities: block deployment
5. If warnings: notify developer, allow with approval
6. Image pushed to registry with signature
7. Deployment verified image signature before deploying

### Scenario 2: Secrets Rotation
1. Application authenticates to Vault using mTLS
2. Vault provides short-lived credentials (1 hour lifetime)
3. Credentials automatically refreshed
4. Old credentials revoked when new ones issued
5. No hardcoded secrets ever stored
6. Audit log shows all access

### Scenario 3: Compliance Automation
1. Every deployment triggers compliance checks
2. Automated verification: HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR requirements
3. Configuration audit against security baselines
4. Real-time compliance dashboard
5. Failed checks block deployment
6. Audit trail for compliance officers

## Career Impact

DevSecOps engineers command premium salaries because they:
- **Reduce risk**: Catch vulnerabilities before they hit production
- **Enable speed**: Automated security means less bottlenecks
- **Ensure compliance**: Never missing audit requirements
- **Build trust**: Customers know the platform is secure

## Getting Started

1. **Learn the fundamentals**: Understand security, not just ops
2. **Pick one tool**: Start with secrets management (Vault) or container scanning (Trivy)
3. **Automate one step**: Add security checks to your CI/CD
4. **Measure**: Track vulnerabilities found, deployment speed
5. **Expand**: Add more checks, more automation
6. **Culture**: Help your team understand security isn't their burden—automation is

## Important Mindset

**Security slows us down** → **Automated security enables us**

The goal isn't to add bureaucracy. The goal is to catch problems early when they're easy and cheap to fix. Security gates are good when they provide fast feedback, not when they're manual bottlenecks.

## Next Steps

- Audit your current CI/CD pipeline for security gaps
- Identify the biggest risk (unscanned containers? Hardcoded secrets?)
- Implement one security improvement this sprint
- Measure the impact and iterate
