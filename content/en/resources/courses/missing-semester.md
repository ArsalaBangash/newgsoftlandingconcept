# The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

An MIT course on the tools and techniques that every software developer should know but few programs teach. From shell basics to advanced Git workflows.

## What You'll Learn

- **Shell scripting** - Automate repetitive tasks
- **Git mastery** - Branching, rebasing, and advanced workflows
- **Vim** - Efficient text editing without leaving the terminal
- **Unix tools** - grep, sed, awk, and other powerful utilities
- **Debugging and profiling** - Find and fix problems efficiently
- **Package managers** - Installing and managing dependencies
- **Dotfiles** - Personalize your development environment

## Why It Matters

These are the unglamorous but essential skills that make developers 10x more productive. Most CS programs skip them entirely, forcing professionals to learn through trial and error.

## Best For

- Anyone learning to code (from day one)
- Professional developers leveling up their toolkit
- Those frustrated by command-line complexity
- Building real developer habits

The skills here compound throughout your entire career. Master them early to accelerate everything that comes next.
