## Why This Matters

Web security isn't just for developers. It's about understanding:
- **How attacks work** - so you can protect yourself
- **Where websites are vulnerable** - to avoid being compromised
- **Defense mechanisms** - how to stay safe online
- **Attack patterns** - recognizing threats
- **Ethical hacking** - learning to think like an attacker to defend

## What You'll Learn

- **Authentication attacks**: Stealing passwords and sessions
- **SQL injection**: How attackers break databases
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious code
- **CSRF**: Tricking you into doing things you didn't intend
- **Logic flaws**: When business rules become vulnerabilities
- **Information disclosure**: Accidental data leaks
- **File upload attacks**: Uploading malicious files
- **Insecure deserialization**: Object manipulation attacks
- **Access control**: Authorization failures

## Hands-On Learning

This isn't just videos. You get:
- **Interactive labs**: Real vulnerable apps to practice on
- **Intentionally broken websites**: Learning by fixing them
- **Real-world scenarios**: How attacks happen in practice
- **Defense techniques**: How to protect against each attack

## Why This Is Freedom Content

- **Activists & journalists**: Understanding attack vectors to protect yourself
- **Bloggers & small sites**: Not getting hacked
- **Anyone online**: Understanding web security threats
- **Developers**: Building systems that don't compromise user data

## Key Principle

If you understand how attacks work, you can defend against them. This knowledge applies whether you're:
- Protecting your own accounts
- Running a website
- Understanding journalist security
- Teaching others about online safety
