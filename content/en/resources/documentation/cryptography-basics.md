## Why This Matters

Cryptography isn't just for security experts. It's the mathematical foundation that:
- **Protects communication** from interception and surveillance
- **Enables privacy** in a connected world
- **Proves authenticity** - ensuring you're talking to who you think you are
- **Powers freedom** - allows secure communication even under oppressive conditions

This Stanford course is the gold standard. Learn from Dan Boneh, one of the world's leading cryptographers.

## What You'll Learn

- **Symmetric encryption**: How data is scrambled and unscrambled
- **Asymmetric encryption**: How people share secrets without meeting
- **Digital signatures**: Proving something came from you
- **Authentication**: Ensuring you are who you claim
- **Real-world applications**: TLS/SSL, VPNs, blockchain, messaging apps

## Who Should Take This

- Security engineers and developers
- Privacy advocates
- Anyone who values digital freedom
- System architects building trustworthy systems
- Anyone curious about how the internet actually works

## Time Commitment

~20 hours over 4-6 weeks. Math-heavy but accessible. Every concept is worth understanding.
